# Electrocardiogram
#### Introduction to Engineering Design: Electrocardiogram Project

Course taken Winter 2019. Project made in collaboration with Ethan Salter and Kasey Murakami.
#### Responsibilities:
- Building circuit: All
- Programming plotter: Kasey
- 3D-printing case: Ethan
- Soldering circuit: Lucas

#### Project Outcomes:
- Constructed ECG to measure electrical activity in the heart using a signal-filtering circuit & Arduino analog read
- Built/connected instrumentation amplifier, bandpass filter, & unipolar non-inverting op-amp to filter heart signal
- Soldered ECG circuit onto 1.5” x 2” perfboard to fit inside compact 3D-printed case and finalize project
